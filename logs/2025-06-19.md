## ✅ What I Learned Today
- Introduced myself to **OpenCV basics using Python**.
- Learned how to:
  - Install OpenCV using `pip install opencv-python`.
  - Read and display an image using `cv2.imread()` and `cv2.imshow()`.
  - Use functions like `cv2.waitKey()` and `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`.

## 🔍 Resources
- 🎥 YouTube Tutorial: [OpenCV Python Tutorial | Computer Vision Basics](https://youtu.be/MVkny_XLK_U)

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- OpenCV is a powerful open-source computer vision library.
- Python + OpenCV is ideal for rapid prototyping in image/video processing.
- Using `cv2.imshow()`, I can visualize outputs from the camera or image files directly.

## 🧠 Thoughts / Reflections
- This was a solid introduction. I now understand how OpenCV fits into the AI + Embedded vision stack.
- Planning to try real-time video capture using my webcam tomorrow.
